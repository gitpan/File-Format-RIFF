Carp instead of die

sanity checking in case of a bad file format

ability to specify chunks by their "path" (made up of "type"s of nested
containers; multiple chunks having the same "id" and "type" in the same
parent container can be differentiated by order; or, defaults to first match)
ex: "INFO/IAUT"; if multiple IAUT's, "INFO/IAUT1" -- assume 0 if not specified

ability to leave data on disk instead of slurping everything into memory

ability to do buffered read/write of data
